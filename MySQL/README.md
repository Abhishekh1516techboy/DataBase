### `SELECT DISTINCT city FROM student;` - Retrieve unique values.
### `SELECT * FROM student ORDER BY marks DESC LIMIT 3;` - Sort and limit results.

### Aggregate Functions
### `SELECT COUNT(marks) FROM student;` - Count rows.
### `SELECT MAX(marks) FROM student;` - Get the highest value.
### `SELECT AVG(marks) FROM student;` - Calculate the average.

### Grouping and Filtering
### `SELECT city, AVG(marks) FROM student GROUP BY city ORDER BY AVG(marks) ASC;` - Group data.
### `SELECT city, marks FROM student WHERE grade='F' GROUP BY city, marks HAVING MAX(marks);` - Use `HAVING` to filter groups.

### Foreign Keys
- Create relationships between tables using foreign keys.
### `FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES course(id) ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE CASCADE;`

### Altering Tables

- Create `employee` table (id, name, salary).
- Insert sample employee data.
- Retrieve employee details.

### Q2: Find the average marks in each city in ascending order.
**Solution:**
```sql
SELECT city, AVG(marks) FROM student GROUP BY city ORDER BY AVG(marks) ASC;
```

### Q3: Count the total payment according to each payment method.
**Solution:**
